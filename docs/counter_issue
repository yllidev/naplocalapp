Lets Start with counter issue
I have faced 4 issues to fixed counter replies

1. when we replying on any request that time reply are saved into conversations table but request_id is not saved

* we need to save request_id in conversations table
let me explain what I have changed for in

conversations_controller.rb
* permit request_id in params

send request_id from frontend with conversation post data
request_id: this.props.request.id

and it will fixed our first problem and save request_id in conversation table


2. we are not getting replies data from replies_controller index method
Why we are not getting replies data after creating reply

because we have a some issue with code


* Request model should be associated with Conversation model usign has_many
    has_many :conversations
* also Conversation model should belongs to Request model
    belongs_to :request
    
    using this association we can easily find out how many replies on request
    like that: request.conversations.count


and finaly we are geting replies and counter is working fine

3. now come to the another issue, if I have alredy replied on request but "Offer help" button is not disabled and "You have already responded to this request!" message was not showing also I can create another reply

so how I have fixed this
we have bugs in checkIfUserResponded method
 * we are using conversation as replies but we don't have volunteer_id in conversation table
 but we have user_id instead of volunteer_id so we need to change volunteer_id to user_id in
 checkIfUserResponded function

4. after creating reply message "You have already responded to this request!" was showing on request model before model close

for that we have remove checkRepliesNumber and fetchRepliesNumber function from submitReply and call into submitMessage after popup close
